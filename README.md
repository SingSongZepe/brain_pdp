# Serial and Parallel simulation of a simple brain model

### serial version

./brain_pdp

cmake project

./brain_pdf.zip is the original zip file, and it is originally not a cmake but only build by gcc (because only a file).



### parallelized version

./vs_parallel2

visual studio c project

./vs_parallel is not a good version, because some MPI_gatherv and leak of memory problem, so I give it up and turn to write a new version.

./parallel is a vscode project but I found it hard to configure the setting making vscode to be good at MPI parallel program coding, so I turn to use visual studio.



### lecture and powerpoint files

./PDP

./PDP.zip is the origin zip file.



### What to do

see it in `parttwo.pdf` of bilingual version `parttwo_bilingual.pdf`.
